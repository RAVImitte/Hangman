# Hangman
Hangman is a quick and easy game for fun sake that requires nothing more than paper, a pencil, and the ability to spell. There is a secret word, which the player tries
to guess by asking what letters it contains. However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing. Hangman can also be customized to make the game easier,
harder, or educational by adding set of random or related words that the player has to guess.
